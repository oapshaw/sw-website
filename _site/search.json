    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nObjectives. To investigate what transpires at opioid overdoses where police administer naloxone and to identify the frequency with which concerns about police-administered naloxone are observed.\nMethods. We reviewed body-worn camera (BWC) footage of all incidents where a Tempe, Arizona police officer administered naloxone or was present when the Tempe Fire Medical Rescue (TFMR) administered it, from February 3, 2020 to May 7, 2021 (n = 168). We devised a detailed coding instrument and employed univariate and bivariate analysis to examine the frequency of concerns regarding police-administered naloxone.\nResults. Police arrived on scene before the TFMR in 73.7% of cases. In 88.6% of calls the individual was unconscious when police arrived, but 94.6% survived the overdose. The primary concerns about police-administered naloxone were rarely observed. There were no cases of improper naloxone administration or accidental opioid exposure to an officer. Aggression toward police from an overdose survivor rarely occurred (3.6%), and arrests of survivors (3.6%) and others on scene (1.2%) were infrequent.\nConclusions. BWC footage provides a unique window into opioid overdoses. In Tempe, the concerns over police-administered naloxone are overstated. If results are similar elsewhere, those concerns are barriers that must be removed."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nPurpose. The evidence on de-escalation training is limited and has focused almost exclusively on use of force as the primary outcome. We evaluate a de-escalation training program in Tempe, Arizona, delivered via a squad-based randomized controlled trial, using methods that tap into alternative outcomes in encounters that did not involve use of force.\nMethods. We conducted phone surveys with 282 randomly selected Tempe community members who had a recent encounter with Treatment and Control officers post-training. We also examined body-worn camera footage of 476 randomly selected encounters that occurred pre- (n = 230) and post-training (n = 246) with Treatment and Control officers.\nResults. Community members reported that trained officers were significantly more likely to use procedural justice and de-escalation; and were more likely to leave them satisfied with their treatment and how their encounter was resolved. Results from BWC footage were less persuasive, though trained officers were more likely to use some de-escalation tactics.\nConclusions. Use of force as a singular metric of a training effect is too narrow. A comprehensive assessment of de-escalation training should consider multiple outcomes, including the potential effects in non-force encounters. Random review of BWC footage and community member surveys are two viable methods for achieving this objective."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe opioid crisis is the most persistent, long-term public health emergency facing the United States, and available evidence suggests the crisis has worsened during the COVID-19 global pandemic. Naloxone is an effective overdose response that saves lives, but the drug does not address problematic drug use, addiction, or the underlying conditions that lead to overdoses. The opioid crisis is at its core a multidisciplinary, multisystem problem, and an effective response to the crisis requires collaboration across those various systems. This paper describes such a collaborative effort. The Tempe First-Responder Opioid Recovery Project is a multidisciplinary partnership that includes police officers, social workers, substance use peer counselors, public health professionals, police researchers, and drug policy/harm reduction researchers. The project, 10 months underway, trained and equipped Tempe (AZ) police officers to administer Narcan. In addition, a 24/7 in-person “Crisis Outreach Response Team” rapidly responds to any suspected overdose and offers follow-up support, referrals, and services to the individual (and loved ones) for up to 45 days after the overdose. We present preliminary project data including interviews with project managers, counselors, and police officers, descriptions of Narcan administrations in the field, and aggregate data on client service engagement. These data highlight the complexity of the opioid crisis, the collaborative nature of the Tempe project, and the importance of initiating a multidisciplinary, comprehensive response to effectively deal with the opioid problem."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nObjectives. We test the impact of de-escalation training on the behavior of officers in the Tempe (AZ) Police Department.\nMethods. The training was delivered via a squad-based randomized controlled trial. We examine administrative use of force data and body-worn camera footage for all use of force encounters six months pre- and post-training. Outcomes include prevalence and force types used, encounter duration, and citizen and officer injuries.\nOutcomes. Use of force declined for Treatment and Control squads, likely because of the global pandemic. Trained officers decreased use of certain force types likely to produce injury. Trained officers spent significantly more time on scene, and they were 58% less likely to injure community members. These changes occurred with no increased risk of officer injury.\nConclusions. The differences in key outcomes are consistent with a positive training effect. Factors that may explain the results include the curriculum development process, focus on officer safety/wellness, officer receptivity, and use of refresher trainings.\nSimilar content being viewed by others"

    "title": "Narcan cops: Officer perceptions of opioid use and willingness to carry naloxone",
    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nBackground: Opioid use has emerged as a significant public health crisis in cities across the United States. In Arizona, opioid overdose deaths increased by 65% from 2016 to 2018, leading the Governor of Arizona to declare a State of Emergency. Because police are often the first to arrive at the scene of an overdose, officers are central to an effective response to the opioid crisis in Arizona and elsewhere. However, many police officers do not carry naloxone, which can immediately reverse the life-threatening effects of an opioid overdose. Few studies examine officer perceptions of opioid use or their willingness to carry and administer naloxone. The degree towhich officers accept this public health responsibility remains unclear.\nMethods: The authors administered two waves of a survey to patrol officers in the Tempe (AZ) Police Department.The officers completed wave 1 approximately three months before the start of a program that trained and outfitted patrol officers with naloxone. Officers completed wave 2 of the survey several months after the program started. Relying on the Opioid Overdose Knowledge (OOKS), Competence, Concerns, and Attitudes (OOAS) of People who Overdose, and Naloxone-Related Risk Compensation Beliefs (NaRRC-B) scales, the survey captures officer attitudes regarding opioid use, willingness to carry and administer naloxone, and perceptions of their role in responding to the opioid crisis.\nResults: At wave 1, officers conveyed moderate levels of confidence in recognizing an overdose and providing life-saving care. Officers indicated strong support for carrying naloxone and responding to opioid overdoses, and they recognized the value of treatment for users. At wave 2, officers reported significantly greater confidence and competence in responding to overdoses, and their support for carrying naloxone also increased. Both before and after program start, there was little variation in attitudes across gender, race/ethnicity, education, and length of service.\nConclusion: Officers accept this public health responsibility as part of their mission. Given that officers are frequently first on scene at overdoses and a matter of seconds can determine life or death, police-led naloxone programs will save lives in Tempe and elsewhere."

    "text": "Abstract\nPurpose – Unlike protests against police brutality in the past (2014 and earlier), police officers responding to First Amendment-protected demonstrations in summer 2020 likely were wearing body-worn cameras(BWCs). This study seeks to understand police perceptions of the effects of BWCs when used in the George Floyd protests.\nDesign/methodology/approach – The authors use survey data from 100 agencies with federally-funded BWCs to assess the prevalence of BWC deployment to George Floyd protests and perceived benefits and limitations of the technology within this unique context.\nFindings – About three-quarters of agencies encountered some level of demonstration/protest related to the killing of George Floyd, and the majority of those deployed BWCs during these demonstrations. Respondents indicated evidentiary value of footage was a key reason for doing so, and at least three preconditions for a civilizing effect were present."
